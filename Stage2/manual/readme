# PASSING A BATCH FILE:
    In order to pass a Batch File to the shell, the user must pass the file path as an argument when running the shell.
    The path to the shell executable must be argument 1 (argv[0]) and the path to the batch file must be argument 2 (argv[1]). E.g. "./customshell batch_file"
    The shell will then execute the commands in the batch file in order, from the beginning to the end of the file.

# THE BATCH FILE:
    The batch file must contain a list of commands, each on a new line.
    The shell will execute each command in the order they appear in the file.

# EXITING THE SHELL FROM A BATCH FILE:
    The shell will automatically exit once the End of File (EOF) is reached in the batch file.
